### Should I bring my umbrella?

Are you going outside? in a mall? going to buy somewhere near? this app suggests if you need to bring your umbrella. It identify the chance of rain. You know, bringing that big bulky long umbrella can cause you trouble (such as losing your 1 hand just to carry it... lol)
